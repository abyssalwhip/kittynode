## Development

- We use [just](https://github.com/casey/just) for development tasks.
- For development speed we only release for aarch64-apple-darwin. But kittynode is cross-platform.
- For local signing use the key `tauri.conf.json` > `bundle` > `macOS` > `signingIdentity` with `security find-identity -v -p codesigning`. The value in `()` is fine.

## Releases

Release branches are (currently) manually created from the `main` branch, and are named `release/vX.Y.Z`. It includes version bumps and a changelog generated by `git-cliff`. After merging the release branch, we create a git tag for that commit. This triggers the `cargo-dist` workflow which handles the actual release.

Here are the release steps:

1. Bump the version in the root `Cargo.toml`.
2. Run `just release-changelog` to generate the changelog.
3. Commit the changelog and version bump with `chore: release vX.Y.Z`.
4. Tag the commit with `git tag vX.Y.Z`.
5. Push the tag with `git push origin vX.Y.Z`.
6. Release crates with `just release-crates`.
7. Release MacOS binaries with `just release-tauri-apple`.
8. Update release notes on GitHub with MacOS binaries.
