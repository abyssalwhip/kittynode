## 1. Should every internet connected device run an Ethereum node?

To have trustless access to the internet, it will be necessary unless they are bootstrapping with weak subjectivity endpoints.

Another question is whether you personally should run multiple nodes or a single node. It seems a bit useless to run multiple validating nodes.

## 2. Should voting in consensus require self-operation of a node, or can an equal amount of good come from a signature and some onchain stake (delegation)?

Current answer: I think that self-operation of a node is something the free market will seek to replace, and some trustless mechanism with liquid staking could be important. 

## 3. Do machines have the same voting rights as humans; and if so, does it open additional attack vectors?

Current answer: Yes.

## 4. How does access to the internet work?

Outside of Ethereum, what are other parts of the "stack"?
