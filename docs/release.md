## Release workflow

Release branches are created from the `main` branch, and are named `release/vX.Y.Z`. It includes version bumps and a changelog generated by `git-cliff`. After merging the release branch, we create a git tag for that commit. This triggers the `cargo-dist` workflow which handles the actual release.

## CICD workflow

#### Lightweight tests on PR

We only run lightweight jobs on PR (lints and unit tests), for example:

- cargo fmt
- crate-ci/typos
- clippy
- unit tests + codecov
- semantic PR title

#### Heavy tests on (unstable) main

We run heavier tests on main to check if we are stable and ready to cut a release. For example:

- heavier integration / e2e tests
- performance tests
